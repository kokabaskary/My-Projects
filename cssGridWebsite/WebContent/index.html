		<h1>What is CSS Grid Layout?</h1>
		<p class="text_paragraph">CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for two-dimensional
			layouts to be created on the web. This guide was created as a
			resource to help you better understand and learn Grid, and was
			organized in a way I thought made the most sense when learning it.</p>

		<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
		<p class="text_paragraph">Grid Layout gives us a method of creating grid structures that
			are described in CSS and not in HTML. It helps us to create layouts
			that can be redefined using Media Queries and adapt to different
			contexts. Grid Layout lets us properly separate the order of elements
			in the source from their visual presentation. As a designer this
			means you are free to change the location of page elements as is best
			for your layout at different breakpoints and not need to compromise a
			sensible structured document for your responsive design. It's very
			easy to make grid adapt to the available space. With each element
			having an area on the grid, things are not in risk of overlapping due
			to text size change, more content than expected or small viewports.</p>
