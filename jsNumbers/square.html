                Write an even better calculator program calc3.html that can
                 understand squared numbers. We are going to use a simplified 
                 notation X^ to mean    .
                For example, x210^ + 7 - 51^ 
                should mean  + 7 −.102512
                Example:
                When reading input5^;1000 + 6^ - 5^ + 1;
                the program should report:251012
                A hint:To take into account ^, don’t add or subtract 
                new numbers right away after reading them. 
                Instead, remember the number, read the next operator
                 and if it is a ^, square the remembered number, then add or subtract it.*/
